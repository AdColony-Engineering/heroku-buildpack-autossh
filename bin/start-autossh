# start-autossh
#
# configures and opens and autossh-backed ssh tunnel to use when installing
# dependencies from artifactory, as it is not available to the public internet.
#
# it depends on the follow environment variables being set:
#   - SSH_TUNNEL_PUBLIC_KEY: the public SSH key for the tunnel. get from the tools
#       team
#   - SSH_TUNNEL_PRIVATE_KEY: the public SSH key for the tunnel. get from the
#       tools team
#   - SSH_TUNNEL_IP: the IP of the ssh tunnel machine to use
#   - SSH_TUNNEL_TARGET_HOST: the host to tunnel to
#   - SSH_TUNNEL_TARGET_PORT: the port to tunnel to
#
# additionally, you can optionally set the following:
#   - SSH_TUNNEL_LISTEN_PORT: the local port to forward traffic to artifactory over
#       (default:  29177)
#
# questions: ask @josh.conner or @azi

    ####
    # Here are the args we pass to autossh and why:
    # "-M 0": We disable monitoring by default (we rely on ServerAliveInterval and
    #         ServerAliveCountMax in ssh to detect whether the connection is still
    #         alive or not and terminate the connection when it is dead, at which
    #         point autossh will restart it). See http://serverfault.com/a/538919
    # "-f": Run as daemon
    #
    # The rest of arguments are passed to `ssh`:
    #   "-N": Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful for just
    #       forwarding ports.
    #   "-o 'ServerAliveInterval 10': Number of seconds between sending a packet
    #       to the server (to keep the connection alive).
    #   "-o 'ClientAliveCountMax 3': Number of above ServerAlive packets before
    #       closing the connection. Autossh will create a new connection when this
    #       happens.
    #   "-i ~/.ssh/ssh_tunnel_rsa": use the ssh tunnel RSA keys
    #   "-L listen_port:artifactory.adtilt.com:80": traffic on `listen_port` should
    #       be "tunneled" to `artifactory.adtilt.com:80`
    #   "ubuntu@$SSH_TUNNEL_HOST": the host to tunnel through
